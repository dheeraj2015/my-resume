### GEN AI Initiatives Across Digital Product Suites

#### AI-Agent Platform for Carbon Emission Reporting (CERius)

- Led the redesign of CERius reporting into an AI-agent–based platform enabling multi-standard, region-specific carbon emission compliance.
- Architected agent workflows for data retrieval, analytics, and automated insights generation, improving accuracy and scalability.
- Delivered interactive emission analysis capabilities, empowering users to identify high-emission assets and explore AI-generated trends and recommendations.

#### AI-Driven Tag Mapping Automation for Industrial Assets

- Directed development of a visual-language + OCR solution to automate 500+ tag mappings per blueprint across 10k+ customer tags.
- Built a scalable framework integrated with SmartSignal and GE product suites, reducing manual engineering effort and deployment timelines.
- Improved data quality and consistency by enabling automatic P&ID-driven validation of mapped tags.

#### Generative AI for Predictive Inspection & Asset Health Insights (APM)

- Executed a strategic PoC integrating work history, inspection summaries, measurements, recommendations, and images into a unified knowledge base.
- Designed AI pipelines to generate asset health insights, recommend optimal inspection intervals, and identify recurring defects and root causes.
- Demonstrated measurable value by enabling proactive maintenance planning and improved asset reliability for industrial customers.

#### Computer Vision Product Development and Launch

Incubated and transformed a computer vision product named [Autonomous Inspection](https://www.gevernova.com), which automates plant inspections through camera and mobile devices.

- Led a cross-disciplinary team of data scientists, front-end, back-end, and cloud engineers in developing and productionizing an AI product with a scalable cloud architecture.
- Launched the product to market in 2023 and led solution testing and implementation on a greenfield site in Germany.
- Built multiple CNN models for detecting industrial assets and corresponding defects, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and keypoint detection.
- Worked with two major oil and gas customers to refine the corrosion module.
- Designed and implemented the end-to-end cloud architecture, including data flow, data processing, and data presentation on UI dashboards.
- Invented and implemented an advanced camera health monitoring solution using image processing techniques to detect unwanted camera motion, blur, focus issues, and zoom changes; applied to surveillance cameras. A patent on this technology is filed and under review.
- Set up a lab with varied RGB and IR camera configurations, forming an IoT-like network. Cameras connect to an edge server via a network switch for real-time photo collection. The edge server processes data and forwards key information to the cloud, enabling solution evaluation prior to customer deployment.

**Key Technologies:** Computer Vision (object detection, segmentation, keypoints), AWS, SageMaker, on-prem data transfer, CI/CD, MLOps, classical image processing  
**Key Skills:** Team technical leadership, AI model training, AI product architecture & implementation, project budgeting, stakeholder communication, lab development and testing, cybersecurity

### Predictive Emissions Monitoring System (PEMS)

Contributing to GE Vernova’s mission of “Electrifying the world while decarbonizing it,” I am leading the development of a Predictive Emissions Monitoring System (PEMS) as part of a broader solution to automate accurate Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reporting and generate actionable insights for emission reduction.

#### Key Contributions

- Designed and led implementation of an adaptive multivariate regression model (Random Forest) to predict key emissions (CO₂, NOₓ, SO₂, HC) using historical plant operational data.
- Enhanced CEMS workflows by:
  - Validating CEMS data and flagging deviations to ensure data integrity.
  - Providing backup emissions estimates during CEMS faults or outages.
  - Handling missing CEMS inputs to maintain continuous and accurate reporting.
- Developed an adaptive learning mechanism to monitor plant behavior, detect data drift or system changes (maintenance, degradation), and automatically retrain models for sustained accuracy.
- Ensured robustness to missing sensor inputs and statistical shifts in plant operations over time.
